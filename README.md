# Memory-Card-Game

Harry Potter themed memory game with Kotlin.

- We have 3 difficulty modes in our memory game. They are easy , medium and hard modes. There are single and multiplayer game options.
- The logic of the game is to match the same cards within the given time and gaining as much as point meanwhile. 
- Each card has its own point and belongs to a house. Each house has their own points. Each time a card is opened, the point calculation process is calculated based on time.
